				<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
				<div class="spacer-point4-rem"></div>
				<button class="faq-question"><h3>Do you have permission to fly commercially?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						Yes, our pilots are all fully qualified, fully insured and possess a PfCO.
					</p>
					<p>
						PfCO stands for &ldquo;Permission for Commercial Operation&rdquo;. This permission is granted by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) only after a pilot has proven, through written and practical examination, that they are competent enough to operate a commercial drone.
					</p>
					<p>
						We hold ourselves to the highest standard, that's why you'll find us on the <a href="https://dronesaferegister.org.uk/company/Milestone-Drones-Ltd" class="text-link">Drone Safe Register.</a>
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>Where are you located?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						Our aerial photography services are based in Bexhill, East Sussex.
					</p>
					<p>	
						It gives us great pleasure to help local businesses, and being a lightweight team, we're often able to provide professional drone services to those much further afield.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please <a href="contact.html" class="text-link">contact us</a> to discuss what's possible. 
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>How much will it cost?</h3></button>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<h5>Pricing</h5>
						<p>
							We will always provide you with a fair, flat quote to accurately reflect the scope of work.
						</p>
						<p>
							Because the equipment, travel costs, software and flight permissions required to complete each project are never the same, we do not charge an arbitrary hourly rate. Instead, we take the time to quote each project independently, and we find that this often helps to reduce the barrier to entry for our clients.
						</p>
						<h5>Special Offers</h5>
						<p>
							We may occasionally run special offers/promotions. To make things simple, we will always begin by agreeing a quote that accurately reflects the scope of work. Once you are happy that this quote is fair, any valid special offer that you wish to redeem is applied on top.
						</p>
					</div>

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>What does your insurance cover?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						Our 3rd party liability ranges from £1-5M as standard, and is assessed on a per project basis. We are insured for every single flight.
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>What safety precautions are taken?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<h5>General</h5>
					<p>
						Prior to and upon arriving at location our team will complete a comprehensive risk assessment to ensure the safety and compliance of everybody involved.
					</p>
					<h5>Crowds</h5>
					<p>
						For crowds of less than 1,000 people we are required to stay 50m away at all times. For crowds larger than 1,000 people this distance increases to 150m.
					</p>
					<p>
						We cannot fly directly over anyone not in our control. To be in our control, a person must have been briefed about the flight taking place, and must understand the simple emergency protocol.
					</p>
					<h5>Privacy</h5>
					<p>
						Just as we value our own privacy, we respect the privacy rights of the public, and appreciate the need for model/property release forms in certain circumstances.
					</p>
					<p>
						Part of every pre-flight check is devoted to protecting the privacy of those in the vicinity, and footage is always reviewed thoroughly for the same reason. Footage where people and/or private locations are identifiable will never be stored/released without consent.
					</p>
				</div> 

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>Can you fly in bad weather?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<h5>Wind</h5>
					<p>
						Drones are remarkably sturdy, but will struggle to fly smoothly in winds above 20mph. Best results are achieved when wind speeds are below 15mph.
					</p>
					<h5>Wet</h5>
					<p>
						To keep our sensitive equipment dry, we do not operate in rain or thick fog. Water on the camera lens will usually spoil the shot anyway, making this impractical.
					</p>
					<h5>Rescheduling</h5>
					<p>
						Because the weather can be unpredictable, we do our best to be as flexible as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the event that bad weather prevents us from flying, and provided that an improvement in the weather can be reasonably expected, we will be willing to wait on site for an agreed upon period of time.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the weather does not improve we will reschedule the flight with you.
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>Can you fly at night?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						Yes, our pilots are qualified to fly at night.
					</p>
					<p>
						For safety reasons, night flying is subject to an on-site survey being undertaken during daylight hours.
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>Can you fly indoors?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						Yes, provided there is enough space.
					</p>
					<p>
						Indoor projects are not subject to as many regulations, or the weather! And it doesn't have to be flying either; our 360&deg; camera shoots in 5K and is perfect for interactive walk-through tours.
					</p>
				</div>

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>How long can you fly for?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						Our drones can typically stay airborne for around 20 minutes before a quick battery change is required. This figure may vary slightly depending on how hard the drone is working, but we carry plenty of batteries.
					</p>
				</div> 

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>How far/high can you fly?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<h5>Height</h5>
					<p>
						Current regulations stipulate a maximum altitude of 400ft (120m). Higher altitudes can be approved on a case by case basis.
					</p>
					<h5>Distance</h5>
					<p>
						Drones are legally allowed to fly 500m away from where the pilot is standing, provided visual line of sight can be maintained at all times. 
					</p>
				</div> 

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>Will I be able to speak with the pilot during the flight?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						Yes. You are very welcome to discuss things with the pilot during the flight, and to see what the drone is seeing while it's in the air. Our pilots appreciate any guidance that helps them to more closely meet your objectives.
					</p>
				</div> 

				<button class="faq-question"><h3>Do I need to be present for the flight?</h3></button>
				<div class="faq-answer">
					<p>
						It's always helpful to have you alongside while we're flying, but rest assured that our pilots know how to get the job done in your absence.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before any flying takes place we'll discuss your requirements thoroughly to make sure that everybody's on the same page.
